To complete these steps, you first need to get avrdude (for OS X, get crosspack: http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html)

cd /Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/hardware/arduino/bootloaders/caterina
avrdude -c dragon_isp  -pm32u4 -Pusb -Uflash:w:Caterina-Leonardo.hex:i -Ulock:w:0x2F:m -Uefuse:w:0xcb:m -Uhfuse:w:0xd8:m -Ulfuse:w:0xff:m -B 6
